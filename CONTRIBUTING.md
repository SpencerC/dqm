# Contributing to Dynamic Quantum Mapping (DQM)

All are welcome! We hope that DQM will grow into a vibrant open-source project and community, in the best senses of the ideas.

Read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

If you're not sure where to begin, check out our [Frequently Asked Questions](https://dqm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html), and then start or join a [discussion](./discussions).

If you want to file a bug report or a feature request, open an [issue](./issues). (Look through existing ones first!)

If you have a contribution to make, create a branch in the repository, make your changes, and then open a [pull request](./pulls). (Ideally, get some buy-in first for whatever you're doing, via [Discussions](./discussions) and [Issues](./issues).)
